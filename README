The idea of this project is to enable scripts to update secured environments without hard coding credentials into scripts or
 entering credentials on each run of a script.
 
 The purpose of a credential server
 ----------------------------------
 Deployment scripts that install or update software on a production server in a production environment most often require credentials to
 access that environment. The purpose of a credential server is to provide those credentials to a script or to any other instance that requires
 credentials to access a certain environment.
