 
 Purpose
 -------
 Enable (ANT) scripts to update secured environments without hard coding credentials into those scripts or
 entering credentials on each run of a script.
 
 Credential Server
 -----------------
 Deployment scripts that install or update software on a production server in a production environment most often require credentials to
 access that environment. A credential server is a component which provides those credentials to scripts or to any other instance that requires
 credentials to access a certain environment.
 
 The goal is to keep credentials out of scripts which access secured enironments like a production server in a production environment.
